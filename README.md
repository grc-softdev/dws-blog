## ðŸš€ How to run the project locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then access: http://localhost:3000

<h2>ðŸ“Œ Improvements</h2>

- We have some prop drilling that can be extracted to the store.
- We can add more tests, added just a few as an example, to outline how it can be done.
- Could have made more abstractions to avoid repetition.
- Had to compromise on time vs quality at times.

<h2>ðŸ“Œ Discussion Points</h2> 

The below are points that should/could have been discussed. We can talk about them sync, but in a nutshell, some decisions had to be made.

- There is no "clear filters" option on the desktop (but we have one on the mobile).
- Several actions were not outlined in the mobile (e.g., Search)
- How the filters should behave: additive vs exclusive.
- How the filters should behave upon deselection on the desktop.
- Category list on mobile example was not clear.
- Dropdown behavior on mobile was atypical (stays on top of cards).
- Dropdown size was not outlined for mobile (too big for mobile).
- "Selected" categories/authors "chips" (post-selection) was not clear.
